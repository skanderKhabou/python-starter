# Python Starter : Become a multi-language developer

Welcome to your second challenge, we hope that you get to learn something new throughout this challenge and, most importantly, that you have fun !

By working on this challenge, you get to see, in practice, the value of something called **Transfer of Knowledge**.

Basically, Transfer of Knowledge is your ability to apply knwoledge you already have in a new, slightly different context.

The context for this challenge is, you guessed it, **coding** ! So, to solve this challenge you will need to use programming concepts you already learnt in Javascript and apply them in Python.

## Why Python ?
Python, like Javascript, are called [General Purspose Programming Languages](https://g.co/kgs/ni2nRd). And by adding it to the list of your technical skills, you will become more useful in a lot more situations, which increases your market value.

## What needs to be done ?

A. Write a Python script which will find all numbers that are :
1. Between 2000 and 3200 (both included)
2. Divisible by 7 
3. **Not** a multiple of 5
HINT: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

B. Update this README.md with the insctruction(s) needed to run that script
```shell
